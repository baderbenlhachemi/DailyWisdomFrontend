# Daily Wisdom App - Frontend

## Overview

The Daily Wisdom App frontend is responsible for displaying random quotes generated by the [Daily Wisdom App Backend](https://daily-wisdom-springboot.onrender.com/api/quotes/random). It allows users to view these quotes and send them to an email recipient.

## Features

1. **Random Quote Display**: The frontend fetches a random quote from the backend and displays it to the user. This is done by making a GET request to the `/api/quotes/random` endpoint of the backend.

2. **Send Quote by Email**: The frontend allows users to send the displayed quote to an email recipient. This is done by making a POST request to the `/api/quotes/sendEmail` endpoint of the backend, with the quote object and the recipient's email address as parameters.
